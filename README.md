Chase wonders through Wander.

Wander aims to facilitate airline ticket sales by allowing users to create their "travel goals". By sharing their dream destinations and activities through their social media, they can earn loyalty points that can be used for their next booking. Airlines can use this to make personalised itineraries to their existing and new customers.

This product was an entry to AirAsia's Airvolution 2017 held in their headquarters at KLIA2, Selangor, Malaysia.
